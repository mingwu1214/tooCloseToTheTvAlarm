# Auto-detect Distance for kids while watching TV (Part 1: A Prototype Using the C270 HD Webcam on Tinker Board)
Are you worried about your kids being too close to watch TV? Worry no more; let me help you overcome this issue. The first part of the “Auto-detect Distance for Kids While Watching TV” series introduces you to the distance detection method using a face detection method with a webcam. That would be an inexpensive and easy way to get kids away from TV.

When the kids are close to the TV, their face width will get bigger and bigger.

So we can use this to estimate how close the kids are to the TV. Following is the recorded video.

After detecting the distance between kids and the TV, we need the Text to Speech function to announce the alert to kids. Through sending the text-to-speech audio to speaker to alarm the too close to the TV announcement.

It’s the blooper while taking pictures in the Mini Photo Studio. Kids were so excited to put a lot of toys in the Mini Photo Studio at that time.

Future Works:

Turn the TV on and off through HDMI-CEC
Use the 3D camera (structured light, stereo, or TOF) to get the accurate depth of objects
Face recognition: Add face recognition to verify the users.
